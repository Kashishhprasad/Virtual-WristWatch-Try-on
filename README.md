# Virtual-WristWatch-Try-on
A browser-based AR application that lets users virtually try on watches in real time using webcam hand detection. Built with TensorFlow.js, JavaScript, and the Canvas API, it dynamically overlays watch images on the user's wrist with support for scaling, rotation, and background removalâ€”all in a responsive, interactive UI.
